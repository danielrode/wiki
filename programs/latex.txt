# Add or subtract what the next enumerate value will be

	\addtocounter{enumi}{44}

If this is added after a list item that is 3., the next item will be 47.


# Start enumerate from specific value in LyX

Start the enumerate environment, then add the following ERT:

	[5.]\setcounter{enumi}{5}

This will start the list at 5.


# Insert images

Insert in preamble:

	\usepackage{graphicx}

Insert in body for each desired image:

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\paperwidth]{imgs/1}

Where "imgs/1" refers to ./imgs/1.png or ./imgs/1.jpg, relative to the directory that the .lyx file resides in.
