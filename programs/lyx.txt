GUIDE

	Often, when commands are run, they are shown briefly in the status bar at the bottom of the window. This is useful if you want to know what the command for a certain action is so you can set a keybinding for it. You can always open the messages pane (under the View menu) to see a history of run commands as well.

	Redock (attach) Outliner Pane
	- Shut down lyx
	- Delete "[views]" section from ~/.config/LyX/lyx.conf file

	Tables
	- Set width of multiple columns by selecting them, right-click, "Settings..."

	If you want a bullet list without the bullet symbol (for example, to use for a series of calculations), simply use the list environment (rather than the itemized one).

	Scale table:
		- insert ERT: \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
		- insert table content
		- insert ERT (after table content): }
		- source: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/10863
			- Usage:
				- \resizebox{<width>}{<height>}
				- You can select ! for the height to make it scale along with the width (the width being '\columnwidth') in the example above.
