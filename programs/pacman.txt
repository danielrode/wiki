# Search for package that provides file X

	- Update the database

		sudo pacman -Fy

	- Search for package

		pacman -F FILENAME

# Downgrade package (from cache)

	sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/old_package_version_path.ext

		This process will remove the current package and install the older version. Dependency changes will be handled, but pacman will not handle version conflicts. If a library or other package needs to be downgraded with the packages, please be aware that you will have to downgrade this package yourself as well.
