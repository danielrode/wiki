KEYS

	v 		Show buffer content in editor (so you can copy text) [1]


FOOTNOTES

	[1] Ensuring 'v' works

		Your ~/.profile must have several variables set for the 'v' key to work 
		correctly:

			export LESSEDIT="%E < %f"
			export VISUAL=hx
			export EDITOR="$VISUAL"

		I am not sure whether just VISUAL or EDITOR need to be set, or both,
		but I do know that less needs to know to use helix as its editor to 
		send the buffer contents to.
